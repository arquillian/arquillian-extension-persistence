* Implemented possibility to define data seeding strategy per each test by using @SeedDataUsing annotation.
* Initial package split for dbunit / core modules.
* Fixed data set comparision by using only those columns which are specified by @ShouldMatchDataSet (taking into account explicitly excluded too).
* Introduced "visitor" for enums to decouple strategy implementation from the enum type - currently used for cleaning and seeding strategies for DBUnit.
* Moved data seeding and cleanup strategy from DBUnit config to general Persistence config.
