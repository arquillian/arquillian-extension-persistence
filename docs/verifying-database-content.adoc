=== Verifying Database Content After The Test

Sometimes it might be a bit cumbersome to assert database state directly
from your testing code. Especially when you change quite a lot in the
database tables you might want to validate values directly in the
database. By using DBUnit you can use the same data sets approach. Put
`@ShouldMatchDataSet` annotation either on the test method or your test
class and Arquillian Persistence Extension will use all these files
together to check if database contains entries you are expecting after
test execution. Again, by convention it first looks for the files in
`datasets` folder. If you don't provide file names in the annotation
itself following rules are applied:

* It's assumed that files are stored in `datasets` folder (or any other
you have configured as default location).
* If annotation is defined on method level, file name has following
format
`expected-[fully qualified class name]#[test method name].[default format]`
* If annotation is defined on class level, file name has following
format `expected-[fully qualified class name].[default format].`

Where `default format` is XML, but <<dbunit-specific-settings, can be also
customized>>.

In addition you can also specify which columns should not be used for
comparision. This might be handy if you export large datasets directly
from the database using tools like
http://jailer.sourceforge.net/[Jailer] and you don't want to compare
surrogate keys (database generated ids). You can specify these columns
in the annotation:

[source,java]
----
@ShouldMatchDataSet(value = "expected-users.yml", excludeColumns = { "id", "creationDate"})
----

To determine order of data sets comparison you can use `orderBy`
attribute:

[source,java]
----
@ShouldMatchDataSet(value = "expected-users.yml", orderBy = { "id"})
----
