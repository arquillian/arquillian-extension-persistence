=== Transactional Tests

Adding transaction support to your tests is pretty straightforward. If
that's only what you need simply put `@Transactional` annotation
either on the test which you want be wrapped in transaction or on the
test class which will result with all tests running in their
transactions.

*Following modes are supported:*

* `COMMIT`: Each test will be finished with `commit` operation. This is
*default* behaviour.
* `ROLLBACK`: At the end of the test execution `rollback` will be
performed
* `DISABLED`: If you have enabled transactional support on the test
class level, marking given test with this mode will simply run it
without the transaction.
