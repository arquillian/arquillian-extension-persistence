Overview
~~~~~~~~

*Arquillian Persistence Extension* is created to help you writing tests
where persistence layer is involved. +
It comes with following features:

* Wrapping each test in the separated transaction.
* Seeding database using:
** http://dbunit.sourceforge.net[DBUnit] with **XML**, **XLS**, *YAML* and
*JSON* supported as data sets format.
** Custom SQL scripts.
* Comparing database state at the end of the test using given data sets
(with column exclusion).

There are just two things which are different from the standard
Arquillian test - `@UsingDataSet` and `@ShouldMatchDataSet annotations`.
Former seeds the database using file in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML] format, and latter verifies
database state using given file. Read on to learn more about the
features offered by **Arquillian Persistence Extension**. If you want to
see more core have a look at
https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-showcase/tree/master/jpa-persistence-extension[our
showcase on Github].

[[transactional-tests]]
Transactional Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding transaction support to your tests is pretty straightforward. If
that's only what you need simply put `@Transactional` annotation
either on the test which you want be wrapped in transaction or on the
test class which will result with all tests running in their
transactions. Following modes are supported:

* `COMMIT`. Each test will be finished with `commit` operation. This is
*default* behaviour.
* `ROLLBACK`. At the end of the test execution `rollback` will be
performed
* `DISABLED`. If you have enabled transactional support on the test
class level, marking given test with this mode will simply run it
without the transaction.

[[seeding-database]]
Seeding Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating ad-hoc object graphs in the test code is often too verbose and
makes it harder to read the tests. Arquillian Persistence Extension
provides alternatives to set database fixtures to be used for the given
test.

[[data-sets]]
Data Sets
^^^^^^^^^

If you are familiar with http://dbunit.sourceforge.net[DBUnit] you already know the
concept of data sets. In brief data sets are files containing rows to be
inserted to the database. In order to seed your database using data set
file put `@UsingDataSet` annotation either on the test itself or on the
class level. If there is definition on both, test level annotation takes
precedence. In addition you can specify files location in the annotation
(default folder is "datasets/". Refer to <<dbunit-specific-settings,
DBUnit configuration section>> to see how can you customize it). If files are
not specified explicitly, following strategy is applied:

* It's assumed that files are stored in `datasets` folder on classpath
(or any other you have configured as default location).
* If annotation is defined on method level, file name has following
format:
`[fully qualified class name]#[test method name].[default format]`.
* If annotation is defined on class level, file name has following
format: `[fully qualified class name].[default format]`.

Where `default format` is XML, but <<dbunit-specific-settings, can be also
customized>>.

Arquillian Persistence Extension handles following formats available out
of the box in DBUnit:

[[flat-xml-data-set]]
Flat XML Data Set
+++++++++++++++++

Simple XML format where each element represents rows in the given table
and attributes names corresponds to its columns. You can also explicitly
set `null` value for the given column, by simply using `[null]` keyword,
as illustrated below.

Flat XML Data Set

[source,xml]
----
<dataset>
    <useraccount id="1" firstname="Clark" lastname="Kent" username="ckent" password="LexLuthor123" nickname="[null]" />
</dataset>
----

[[excel-spreadsheets]]
Excel Spreadsheets
++++++++++++++++++

Another format supported out of the box by DBUnit. In order to use it
follow these conventions:

* Each table should have dedicated sheet within the Excel file.
* First row should contain column labels.

Have a look at the
https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-persistence/blob/master/int-tests/src/test/resources-datasets/datasets/single-user.xls[example].

[[yaml-and-json]]
YAML and JSON
+++++++++++++

In addition to the format supported out of the box by DBUnit, Arquillian
Persistence Extension provides alternative way to describe your data
sets either by using YAML or JSON. Those formats are a bit more readable
for the human (and for machines too!). So instead of hand-crafting XML
or Excel files you can do define your data sets in
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML[YAML]:

Data set described in YAML

[source,java]
----
useraccount:
  - id: 1
    firstname: Clark
    lastname: Kent
    username: ckent
    password: LexLuthor123
    nickname: "[null]"
----

or in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation[JSON]:

Data set described in JSON

[source,java]
----
{
  "useraccount":
  [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "firstname" : "Clark",
      "lastname" : "Kent",
      "username" : "ckent",
      "password" : "LexLuthor123",
      "nickname" : "[NULL]"
    }
  ]
}
----

[[section]]

[[schema-creation]]
Schema Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use custom SQL scripts for schema creation you can
decorate your test using `@CreateSchema` annotation providing list of
scripts you want to execute before test class. They will be executed
only once. By convention such scripts will be first looked in *schema*
folder, but you can also provide full path if you wish.

[[custom-sql-scripts]]
Custom SQL Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want you can also use seed your database using plain SQL (or
execute any other action directly on the database level). To achieve it
simply put `@ApplyScriptBefore` or `@ApplyScriptAfter` annotation either
directly on your test method or on the test class. Scripts will be
executed before or after test method accordingly. If there is definition
on both, test level annotation takes precedence.

By convention Arquillian Persistence Extension will look for these
scripts in theÂ **scripts** folder (in a Maven project, that's typically
`src/test/resources/scripts` in the source tree), but you can customize
it as you wish - see <<general-settings, configuration
section>> how to do it. You can also specify files location in the
annotation, the same way as you can do with DBUnit data sets. If files
are not specified explicitly, following strategy is applied:

* It's assumed that files are stored in `scripts` folder (or any other
you have configured as default location).
* If annotation is defined on method level, file name has following
format:
`[before|after]-[fully qualified class name]#[test method name].sql`.
* If annotation is defined on class level, file name has following
format: `[before|after]-[fully qualified class name].sql`.

[[verfying-database-content-after-the-test]]
Verifying Database Content After The Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it might be a bit cumbersome to assert database state directly
from your testing code. Especially when you change quite a lot in the
database tables you might want to validate values directly in the
database. By using DBUnit you can use the same data sets approach. Put
`@ShouldMatchDataSet` annotation either on the test method or your test
class and Arquillian Persistence Extension will use all these files
together to check if database contains entries you are expecting after
test execution. Again, by convention it first looks for the files in
`datasets` folder. If you don't provide file names in the annotation
itself following rules are applied:

* It's assumed that files are stored in `datasets` folder (or any other
you have configured as default location).
* If annotation is defined on method level, file name has following
format
`expected-[fully qualified class name]#[test method name].[default format]`
* If annotation is defined on class level, file name has following
format `expected-[fully qualified class name].[default format].`

Where `default format` is XML, but <<dbunit-specific-settings, can be also
customized>>.

In addition you can also specify which columns should not be used for
comparision. This might be handy if you export large datasets directly
from the database using tools like
http://jailer.sourceforge.net/[Jailer] and you don't want to compare
surrogate keys (database generated ids). You can specify these columns
in the annotation:

[source,java]
----
@ShouldMatchDataSet(value = "expected-users.yml", excludeColumns = { "id", "creationDate"})
----

To determine order of data sets comparison you can use `orderBy`
attribute:

[source,java]
----
@ShouldMatchDataSet(value = "expected-users.yml", orderBy = { "id""})
----

[[data-insert-strategies]]
Data Insert Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DBUnit, and hence Arquillian Persistence Extension, provides following
strategies for inserting data

[[insert]]
INSERT
^^^^^^

Performs insert of the data defined in provided data sets.Â This is the
default strategy.

[[clean_insert]]
CLEAN_INSERT
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Performs insert of the data defined in provided data sets, after removal
of all data present in the tables (DELETE_ALL invoked by DBUnit before
INSERT).

[[refresh]]
REFRESH
^^^^^^^

During this operation existing rows are updated and new ones are
inserted. Entries already existing in the database which are not defined
in the provided data set are not affected.

[[update]]
UPDATE
^^^^^^

This strategy updates existing rows using data provided in the datasets.
If dataset contain a row which is not present in the database
(identified by its primary key) then exception is thrown.

Data seeding strategy can be specified globally in `arquillian.xml`.
Please refer to the <<general-settings, configuration
section>> for the details.

[[cleaning-your-data]]
Cleaning Your Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[dbunit-cleanup-modes]]
DBUnit Cleanup Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arquillian Persistence Extension comes with great degree of
configuration. In combination with data sets which you use to seed the
database you can also specify when and how you would like your database
to be cleaned. By default your database is entirely erased before each
test. If you want to control this behavior, use `@Cleanup` annotation
for this purpose. You can define it on the test method level or globally
by decorating test class. Following modes are currently supported:

[[strict]]
STRICT
++++++

Cleans the entire database. This strategy might require turning off
database constraints (e.g. referential integrity).

[[used_rows_only]]
USED_ROWS_ONLY
++++++++++++++

Deletes only those entries which were defined in data sets used for
seeding.

[[used_tables_only]]
USED_TABLES_ONLY
++++++++++++++++

Deletes only those tables which were used in data sets.

You can also specify when you would like to invoke the cleanup
procedure. For instance:

[source,java]
----
@Cleanup(phase = TestExecutionPhase.AFTER, strategy = CleanupStrategy.USED_ROWS_ONLY)
----

You can invoke it `BEFORE` or `AFTER` the test. You can also disable
cleanup by using `TestExecutionPhase.NONE`.

[[using-custom-sql-scripts-for-cleanup]]
Using Custom SQL Scripts For Cleanup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use custom SQL scripts to clean your database before or
after the test. For this purpose use `@CleanupUsingScript` annotation
and specifies SQL files which have to be executed. If you don't provide
file names in the annotation itself following rules are applied:

* It's assumed that files are stored in `scripts` folder (or any other
you have configured as default location).
* If annotation is defined on method level, file name has following
format `cleanup-[fully qualified class name]#[test method name].sql`
* If annotation is defined on class level, file name has following
format `cleanup-[fully qualified class name].sql`

The same way as with DBUnit cleanup you can also define test phase when
it should take place.

[[other-goodies]]
Other Goodies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* You can use scriptsToExecuteBeforeTestÂ and
scriptsToExecuteAfterTestÂ scripts to turn off and bring back referential
integrity checks for each tests using single, global definition
externalized from the test class. This way your tests are portable and
you can use different profiles with database specific `arquillian.xml`
configurations transparently.
* You can dump database content for each test execution and use it later
for debugging purposes.

See following section for details how to configure those features.

[[additional-configuration]]
Additional Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Arquillian Persistence Extension* can be customized in the similar way
as any other components from Arquillian ecosystem - through
`<extension>` elements defined in `arquillian.xml`. Following sections
describe all possible settings which you can use to tweak the extension
for your environment.

Transaction management is delegated to Transaction Extension as of
1.0.0.Alpha6 version. Therefore if you want to specify JNDI for the
`UserTransaction`, please use following snippet in the `arquillian.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="transaction">
    <property name="manager">java:jboss/UserTransaction</property>
</extension>
----

[[general-settings]]
General Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can customize *Arquillian Persistence Extension* configuration in
`arquillian.xml` by adding following element:

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="persistence">
    <property name="defaultDataSource">java:app/datasources/mssql_ds</property>
</extension>
----

*List of all available properties*

[cols="1,1,8",options="header"]
|===
|Property name |Default value |Description

|`defaultDataSource`
|_none_
|Name of the default data source used to interact with the database
(seeding, comparing etc). Required if not specified by using
`@DataSource` annotation.

|`defaultTransactionMode`
|COMMIT
|Transaction mode for running the tests if not specified explicitly by
using `@Transactional`. Possible values: COMMIT, ROLLBACK or DISABLED.

|`dumpData`
|false
|Enables database state dumping in following phases BEFORE_SEED,
AFTER_SEED, BEFORE_CLEAN, AFTER_CLEAN. Might be handy for debugging.
(Boolean.)

|`dumpDirectory`
|OS-specific tmp directory defined in `java.io.tmpdir`
|Folder where all database dumps will be stored.

|`defaultCleanupPhase`
|AFTER
|Defines default cleanup phase. Possible values: BEFORE, AFTER, NONE. If
not defined on the test method or class level this setting is used.

|`defaultCleanupStrategy`
|STRICT
|Defines strategy of cleaning database content for the test. Possible
values: STRICT, USED_ROWS_ONLY orÂ USED_TABLES_ONLY.Â If not defined on
the test method or class level this setting is used.

|`defaultDataSeedStrategy`
|INSERT
|Defines strategy of inserting data to the database. Possible values:
INSERT, CLEAN_INSERT, UPDATE or REFRESH.
|===

[[dbunit-specific-settings]]
DBUnit Specific Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Arquillian Persistence Extension* provides a way to customize
underlying behaviour of DBUnit
(http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/properties.html[exposed as properties and
features]) and some other customizations.

[source,xml]
----
<extension qualifier="persistence-dbunit">
    <property name="datatypeFactory">org.dbunit.ext.mssql.MsSqlDataTypeFactory</property>
    <property name="useIdentityInsert">true</property>
    <property name="excludePoi">true</property>
</extension>
----

*List of all available properties*

[cols="1,1,8",options="header"]
|===
|Property name |Default value |Description

|`defaultDataSetLocation`
|"datasets/"
|Folder where all datasets are located.

|`defaultDataSetFormat`
|XML
|Default format of data sets when file name is inferred from test method
name, when file is not specified in `@UsingDataSet` or
`@ShouldMatchDataSet`. Other supported formats are EXCEL, YAML and JSON.

|`excludePoi`
|false
|Excludes Apache POI from packaging process, which results in slimier
deployment. If you are not using Excel datasets you can safely turn it
off.

|`batchedStatements`
|false
|Enable or disable usage of JDBC batched statement by DBUnit.

|`caseSensitiveTableNames`
|false
|Enable or disable case sensitive table names. If enabled, DBUnit handles
all table names in a case sensitive way.

|`qualifiedTableNames`
|false
|Enable or disable multiple schemas support. If enabled, DBUnit access
tables with names fully qualified by schema using this format:
SCHEMA.TABLE.

|`datatypeWarning`
|true
|Enable or disable the warning message displayed when DBUnit encounter an
unsupported data type.

|`skipOracleRecycleBinTables`
|false
|Enable or disable the processing of oracle recycle bin tables (tables
starting with BIN$). Oracle 10g recycle bin tables may break DBUnit's
assumption of tables name uniqueness within a schema since these table
are case sensitive. Enable this feature for Oracle 10g databases until
the bug in the oracle driver is fixed, which incorrectly reports this
system tables to DVUnit.

|`escapePattern`
|_none_
|Allows schema, table and column names escaping. The property value is an
escape pattern where the ? is replaced by the name. For example, the
pattern "
[?]
" is expanded as "
[MY_TABLE]
" for a table named "MY_TABLE". The most common escape pattern is
"\"?\"" which surrounds the table name with quotes (for the above
example it would result in "\"MY_TABLE\""). As a fallback if no
questionmark is in the given string and its length is one it is used to
surround the table name on the left and right side. For example the
escape pattern "\"" will have the same effect as the escape pattern
"\"?\"".

|`tableType`
|_none_
|Used to configure the list of table types recognized by DBUnit.

|`datatypeFactory`
|`org.dbunit.dataset.datatype.DefaultDataTypeFactory`
|Used to configure the DataType factory. You can replace the default
factory to add support for non-standard database vendor data types.
Provided class must implement
`org.dbunit.dataset.datatype.IDataTypeFactory`.

|`statementFactory`
|`org.dbunit.database.statement.PreparedStatementFactory`
|Used to configure the statement factory. Provided class must implement
`org.dbunit.database.statement.IStatementFactory`.

|`resultSetTableFactory`
|`org.dbunit.database.IResultSetTableFactory`
|Used to configure the ResultSet table factory. Provided class must
implement `org.dbunit.database.CachedResultSetTableFactory`.

|`primaryKeyFilter`
|_none_
|Use to override primary keys detection. Provided class must implement
`org.dbunit.dataset.filter.IColumnFilter`.

|`identityColumnFilter`
|_none_
|Use to override IDENTITY column detection (MS SQL specific solution).
Provided class must implement `org.dbunit.dataset.filter.IColumnFilter`.

|`batchSize`
|100
|Size of the batch updates.

|`fetchSize`
|100
|The statement fetch size for loading data into a result set table.

|`metadataHandler`
|`org.dbunit.database.DefaultMetadataHandler`
|Used to configure the handler used to control database metadata related
methods. Provided class must implement
`org.dbunit.database.IMetadataHandler`

For MySQL users...

If you are using MySQL, you must use
`org.dbunit.ext.mysql.MySqlMetadataHandler` or you will get the "No
columns found" error. See http://sourceforge.net/p/dbunit/bugs/226/.

|`useIdentityInsert`
|false
|Disables MS SQL Server automatic identifier generation for the execution
of inserts. For usage with Microsoft driver you should append your JDBC
connection with "SelectMethod=cursor".

|`excludeTablesFromCleanup`
|_empty_
|List of tables to be excluded from cleanup procedure. +
Â  Â  * Especially handy for sequence tables which are most likely to be
cleared +
Â  Â  * when using STRICT cleanup strategy. +
Comma separated list of table names to be excluded from cleanup
procedure. Especially handy for sequence tables which are otherwise
cleared when using STRICT cleanup strategy.

|`schema`
|_empty_
|Database schema name to be used by DBUnit

[[maven-setup]]
Maven Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll first need to setup Arquillian in your project. You can find
instructions in the
http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started/#add_the_arquillian_apis[Getting
Started guide]. You'll also need to add an Arquillian container adapter
for a container which provides JPA. Any Java EE 6 server will do, such
as JBoss AS 7 or GlassFish 3.1. Adding the required container adapter to
your project is also covered in the
http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started/#add_more_containers[Getting
Started guide].

The only extra dependency you need is the Arquillian Persistence
Extension implementation, `arquillian-persistence-dbunit`
(formerÂ `arquillian-persistence-impl`), as shown in the snippet below.
