=== Data Insert Strategies

DBUnit, and hence Arquillian Persistence Extension, provides following
strategies for inserting data:

* `INSERT` +
Performs insert of the data defined in provided data sets.Â This is the
default strategy.

* `CLEAN_INSERT` +
Performs insert of the data defined in provided data sets, after removal
of all data present in the tables (DELETE_ALL invoked by DBUnit before
INSERT).

* `REFRESH` +
During this operation existing rows are updated and new ones are
inserted. Entries already existing in the database which are not defined
in the provided data set are not affected.

* `UPDATE` +
This strategy updates existing rows using data provided in the datasets.
If dataset contain a row which is not present in the database
(identified by its primary key) then exception is thrown.

Data seeding strategy can be specified globally in `arquillian.xml`.
Please refer to the <<additional-configuration#general-settings, configuration
section>> for the details.
