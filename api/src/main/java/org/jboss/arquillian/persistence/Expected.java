/**
 * Verifies state of underlying data store using data sets
 * defined by this annotation. Verification is invoked after test's
 * execution (including transaction if enabled).
 *
 * <br />
 * If files are not specified explicitly, following strategy is applied:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Assumption that files are stored in <code>datasets</code> folder.</li>
 *   <li>
 *       If {@link Data} annotation is defined on method level, file name has following format:
 *       <i>expected-[fully qualified class name]#[test method name].[default format]</i>.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       If {@link Data} annotation is defined on class level, file name has following format:
 *       <i>expected-[fully qualified class name]#.[default format]</i></li>.
 * </ul>
 * <br /><br />
 * If not specified in <code>arquillian.xml</code>, then expected format is XML.
 *
 * Presence of this annotation in the test class will enable Arquillian Persistence Extension.
